Hi there, welcome to my blog! 
This isn't intended to be a professional page nor a concentrate of tutorials, but rather a place to reflect on my life and my journey.
I will try to keep it short and avoid to spread too wide, the writing will be more like a daily review of my progress in the fields I'm trying to break into / the aspects of life I wanna explore! 
thanks for reading!


Sept 5, still in Nha trang.
Seeing my irl friends going back to school was kind of a smol internal win at a first glance... "that's it I'm the shadowy crypto 21yo hustling from a skypool" but the truth is much more subtle.

Being on my own makes me feel everything more intensely:
I deeply savor the satisfaction of finishing a chapter, feel so grateful for eating a sandwich paid by the money I worked for.
I enjoy 10x more the shots of dopamine when I send pull request.
I feel in control on many aspects of my life and that brings me a lot of internal peace.

But it also takes away all my excuses, the feeling of loneliness is heightened, the regrets of making a bad trade as well, and especially, every time I tell myself I could have been more efficient or worked longer, I'm the only one to blame. 

I guess it's healthy to look at yourself in the mirror, detached from any influence.
Maybe my dream of discovering the world was never more than a desire to discover myself!

Otherwise, concretely, I continue to work on an internal project for my DAO (some blockchain rust tooling), I'm sharpening my general (and technical) knowledge on software engineering: 2 chapters of DDIA, 1 leetcode, and some repo reading/ ytb.

On a physical level, I'm still trying to regulate my body composition: it was the first day of a 12 weeks coaching to help me with the shred and go from about 15% BF to more or less 10%.

Without elaborating on my deep reflections, I feel a bit like Batman going to train with Ra's al Ghul. I hope to open the spiritual side of my life, while honing my weapons.

still enjoying the beach tho :')
