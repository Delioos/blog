lacked  bit on blogging, no specifics reasons, just had to move many times and kept my time for pushing the projects (and watiching a bit of bleach ngl). But I'm back at it!

# travel update
- still in vietnam 
Didn't move really far, but I did get to see new spots in Nha Trang. Really enjoying the sea view tbh. 1e milk coffee + palms tree really are fullfilling.

- met the buddies
Finally got to meet the ceo + reunited (almost) the whole Altitude team.
Very happy to work with such goated people tbh.

- next steps
planning to go to the north, Hanoi was delayed due to typhoon. But I really hope to see the capital + Ha Long Bay. I'm really excited tbh.

# Career update
- Wallet tracker should be up and running in less than 48h
- secret project is almost up too and I'm hyped to launch new features to monetize it
- Built a solid  trajectory for the 3/4 next years. (Skillset will be everything in the web3 jungle) - in three words: sol and rust
