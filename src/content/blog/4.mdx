Smol post, but big moves:

- Dove deep into EVM intricacies. Devoured two articles from Noxx's substack:
  - Completed part 3
  - Finished part 4 + took some notes and settled up an obsidian vault
  concl: evm goes brr

- Made massive pushes on the bot project:
  - Polished the API, making it clean and well-refactored with consistent HTTP responses throughout
  - Kicked off the notification manager development

- Took a breather to read an article by gp (gp me manque). 

- Checked out the Solana rareskill. Fascinating to see innovations in this ever-evolving ecosystem.


Tomorrow's looking just as exciting. Still so much to explore and create.
