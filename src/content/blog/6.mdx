Another day of progress, and I'm feeling accomplished:

- Finished a draft of the wallet tracker. It's coming together nicely, and I'm excited to refine it further.

- Read "Get a Job" de Thuna (cool commmunity made by the goat on how to make it to the corpo realm. It provided some valuable insights that I already used (writing a gud cv is a great start)

- Caught up on some emails. 

- Explored bullish projects that I can add to my CV. Definitely lacking huge accomplishments in the web3 space, hackaton will be on top of the experience in a few months I hope.

- Read another article by gp. 

- Studied one LeetCode pattern. Progress is progress, no matter how small!

- Put some work on the wallet tracker.

Every small step adds up, and I'm looking forward to what tomorrow brings!
