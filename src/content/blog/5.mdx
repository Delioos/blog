Another day, another smol post packed with progress:

- Kicked off day one of 60 days of Solana. The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single  "hello world"

- Finished the novel about Monet. 

- Pushed code like there's no tomorrow. The git log is looking healthier than my sleep schedule.

- Rustlings: tackled one exercise per chapter. Rust is starting to feel less like wrestling and more like dancing.

- Dove into 2 LeetCode patterns. 

- Anki'd my way through some Italian. 

- Devoured another article by GP. 

- Made solid progress on the subscribe manager:
  - Implemented `get_subscribers(wallet: String) -> Vec<i32>`. 
  - Pondering whether to denormalize for that sweet performance boost. Future me problem?


_Past generations studied the art of war and politics to bring peace, so their sons could study science and finance to create generational wealth, so their sons could become writers and painters. The beauty of today's world is that this cycle is achievable in a single lifespan. Moreover, 'war' - finance and science - and a certain form of art can cohabitate through software engineering._
